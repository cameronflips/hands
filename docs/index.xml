      <description>help help help
ive fallen
to my demons
no one to call
help
evac required
I have fallen
I felled
dear helen
I don&amp;rsquo;t know
whose thoughts these are
that write this now
but I love you
and I have lost control
not that control was ever attained
only illusion of it
yet it feels so good
that illusion
to be in control
of self and self at large</description>

      <description>Friday 2pm {{already&amp;gt;!?}} we just had breakfast in a way it feels like
had a nice park session with bagels goat cheese fig spread and apple juice with ghost at the park by the painted ladies. having a nice day but I&amp;rsquo;m a little paralyzed about the money situation but I don&amp;rsquo;t care I know my dreams will come true if I keep working on them || like when it gets to the point where I don&amp;rsquo;t have a meal option again, I&amp;rsquo;ll just go record someone&amp;rsquo;s story I just meet and make a song out of it, do a few hundred of those and people will start caring.</description>
