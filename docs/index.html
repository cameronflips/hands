Ive been handwriting poliwat on this clipboard I spray painted red months ago and it&rsquo;s been a nice calming change of pace. Hands.poliw.at is the new brain dump
but stayed up till like 4-5 am don&rsquo;t remember making this site, and then made the song site too cause that&rsquo;s real needed.
