<h4 id="2-world-my-stage-though-i-feel-more-a-prop">2 - World my stage though I feel more a prop</h4>

<pre><code>
world my stage though I feel more a prop
cluses I've learned from view in rearview mob
my tongue blunt tool tongue she like on pop
world my stage though I feel more a prop

I think of life like a book that my hook
I writing it I the main character I act it
caesar said world your stage
and its up to you what role you play
highlights high life my life it romantic god damn it
razor sharp focus every rose I notice
my religion more women in power
I think mamma love a super power
Imma a sucka though just a sucka
Imma sucka for hyrulle herb quick jab bad meme cute cat
girl that make art with her hands yeah
like ma ma ma ma ma ma ma who write
20 post it notes a day
alcoholic I saw the pattern then I trained
my mental screaming I'd walk the plank
walk the plank for my dreams
type fuck
barefeet on the coffee table high life like
roller coaster no coasters 4 dads coronas
lows worth the highs highs come in 50 flavors
I 50 shades of mic
50 shades of mic? 50 shades of pride!
50 sahdes of couldn't curb my taste for a glock 9
50 shades of why?
{chorus}
world my stage though I feel more a prop
clues I've learned from view in rearview mob
my tongue blunt tool
tongeu she like on pop
world my stage though I feel more a prop

<pre><code>
You'll need a lighter to hire me
I aspire to conquer
perspire till you retire
I think in code on computer
I walking you stalked
I feeling you heeling at uni
barely breaking even but breaking
glass ceiling

<h4 id="4-grasshopper-my-grasshopper">4 - Grasshopper my Grasshopper</h4>

<pre><code>
Grasshopper my Grasshopper
I need a mentor I need a guru

Grasshopper  my grasshopper
I speak to you in total confidence from consequence in pool
go go girl
straight postal in my post office
be super nice cause most are lost
most are proud few are loud I am proud I
a prophet of my past
predicated upon all past mistakes
If I love Jimminy cricket spitting to crickets my miss takes
I spit to you my grasshopper
I need a mentor I need a guru
I cannot fake this
I cannot work here no more  
I cannot work here no more
I cannot work here no more
I cannot work here no more
I cannot work here no more

say tik tok
addicted afflicted to make a nonprofit
I cannot even

and the grasshopper said

why you fuck the earth, my friend
with confidence my friend
with eloquence my freind
with arrogance my friend
don't get stoned! throw stones from yo glass house
complain bout life though your martini full now
