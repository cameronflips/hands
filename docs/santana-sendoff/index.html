<p>| | I want to get chips for sure hahahaha at the 7 11 and I think helen will be down</p>

<p>we fight everytime we share a scoot cause she feels unsafe and wants to jump off every 2 blocks and I get impatient cause there&rsquo;s no need to stop 90% of the time and I was carrying both backpacks and it hurt to stop and we both said I hate you and she flipped me off and I left to pee and this is my side in a fraction and I used it before so Imma use it again - 90% sure we won&rsquo;t fight
and damn it&rsquo;s beautiful out here in a cool weird way, driving across to what looks like treasure island the radioactive dump and Imma text chad : D during the concert | send him a video</p>

<p>who knows the screenplay contiunues, I continue, and there&rsquo;s nothing else asde from the presense of the beeping quickly overtaking anthirng beautiful from the radio and shadowing it with an ugly acoustical reminder of time time time time time time time time time time time itme.</p>
